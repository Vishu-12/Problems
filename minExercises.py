
# Today you decided to go to the gym. You currently have energy equal to E units. There are N exercises in
# the gym. Each of these exercises drains Ai amount of energy from your body.
# You feel tired if your energy reaches 0 or below. Calculate the minimum number of exercises you have
# to perform such that you become tired. Every unique exercise can only be performed at most 2 times as
# others also have to use the machines.
# If performing all the exercises does not make you feel tired, return -1.

# Parameters:
# E :: INTEGER
# The first line contains an integer, E, denoting the Energy.
# E :: 1 -> 10^5
# N :: INTEGER
# The next line contains an integer, N, denoting the number of exercises.
# N :: 1 -> 10^5
# A :: INTEGER ARRAY
# Each line i of the N subsequent lines (where 0 â‰¤ i < N) contains an integer describing the amount of
# energy drained by i-th exercise.
# A[i] :: 1 -> 10^5

# Test Cases
# Case#: 1
# Input:
# 6
# 2
# 1
# 2
# Output:
# 4
# E = 6
# Do 1st exercise 2 times
# Do 2nd exercise 2 times
# Hence, total exercises done 4.
